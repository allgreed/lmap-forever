# lmap-forever
Backing service for lmap, designed for running locally and storing the state

## Prerequisites
- [nix](https://nixos.org/nix/manual/#chap-installation)
- `direnv` (`nix-env -iA nixpkgs.direnv`)
- [configured direnv shell hook ](https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html)
- some form of `make` (`nix-env -iA nixpkgs.gnumake`)

Hint: if something doesn't work because of missing package please add the package to `default.nix` instead of installing on your computer. Why solve the problem for one if you can solve the problem for all? ;)
